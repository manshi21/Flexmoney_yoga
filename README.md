This yoga application is developed by python and django using html, CSS and Bootstrap. This application has several features including sign in , sign up and password valitdation
By this application user can contact the instructor of Yoga and the administration also. I used Django for hosting the application in a local server. Django is preferrable 
because it provides a default admin page and very reliable to use. Users can forget the password after providing some valid input for authentication. This dashboard of the application 
show the transaction history of the users. I have used PostregeSql because it is familiar with me using ORM model which is compaitable with Django framework .
